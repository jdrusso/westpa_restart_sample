# WESTPA/OpenMM HDF5 demo

The goal of this is to run a simulation that does the absolute minimal amount of disk IO.
So, the simulation itself is done in OpenMM, which does not write trajectory files to disk, 
and gives us immediate access to the simulation results in memory.


## Setup 

1. Create your environment with 
`conda create -c conda-forge -c omnia -n openmm westpa openmm openmmtools python=3.6`

Need python <= 3.7 for OpenMM and <= 3.6 for OpenMMtools.

2. Initialize the system with `minimize_system_gpu.py`.

This takes a topology and structure file and initializes the system.
The integrator, thermostat, and barostat are all defined here.

This also runs minimization, and 1000 steps of dynamics for equilibration.

This takes ~7.5 minutes on a quad-core 2.8GHz Macbook Pro w/ an Iris Plus 655 1.5GB VRAM iGPU (this matters because it's openGL accelerated).

3. Run `./init.sh`

4. Run `./run.sh`

You should be able to cancel it mid-iteration, then re-run with `run.sh`, and have it restart from the previous iteration.

If it's hanging on a single segment left in an iteration after restarting, use `w_truncate` to scrap the previous iteration.
I remember from a while ago that sometimes it was necessary to do that before restarting.
